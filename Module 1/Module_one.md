# Module 1 - Basic Programming

## Module objectives:
* Learn to manipulate files and directory structures using the command line.
* Learn to track changes to your code using git version control
* Learn to write small programs using Ruby


## Plans to achieve:
1. Complete Challenge Command Line & Git
2. Complete ruby programming
3. Read through phase one and two 

## Evidence
1. Command line and git challenge repo [here](https://github.com/Brit-Amber/cmd_line_git_challenge)
2. Completed the password validator challenge 1 and 2 [here](https://github.com/Brit-Amber/ruby_foundations)

## What i've learnt
- How to use command line 
- The value of git version control 
- Basics of ruby programming & syntax

## Reflection

### Question 1 
Did you meet all of your goals that you set at the beginning of the week?

- Yes and no, I feel a lot more confident in git version control and now know how to manipulate files & directories using the command line. However I wasn't able to complete the last challenge in the rubby programming, which was password validator 3. Unfortunetly I hit a blocker on the previous chapter which meant that I didn't have enough to complete the rest of the materials. 


### Question 2
What would you improve/change moving forward?

- I would like to get better at ask for help when I am stuck, especially once I have tried to fix it multiple times. 
- Learn what to google to get the answers I need to help resolve my blockers and errors. 
- I would like to imprive my understanding in Ruby syntax and learn more about the different methods.
- Be stricter with timekeeping and taking breaks
