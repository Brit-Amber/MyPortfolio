# Module 3 - Databases

## Module objectives:
* Design a database schema with at least two tables from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create a schema in a database using SQL.
* Use SQL to query a database to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete.
* Integrate a relational database to a progra, by test-driving classes with implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.

## Plans to achieve:
1. Complete SQL bites
2. Complete designing a repository class
3. Complete repository class "find" method
4. Complete designing a repository class "create" and "delete" methods

## Evidence
1. Designing a repository class [here]
2. Complete repository class "find" method [here]
3. Complete designing a repository class "create" and "delete" methods [here]

## What i've learnt

- How to create a database and input onto the database using sql
- How to create a database with two tables 
- How to link a database with ruby 

## Reflection

### Question 1 
Did you meet all of your goals that you set at the beginning of the week?

- I completed my goals this week and have learnt a lot about databases and sql. I have enjoyed learning about this and being able to use the skills that I have learnt this past week. My biggest blockers this week was seeting up the repository and the databse, especially with syntax errors and name errors. However I have been using TDD more and the debugging process. 

### Question 2
What would you improve/change moving forward?

- Follow the TDD process more strictly, as it saves time in the long run
- Definetly take more breaks - noticed that at the end of the day I make a lot more of spelling mistakes. 
- Try not to rush to much through materials and remember it is about learning not how much you complete.
