# Module 2 - Golden Square Practices

## Module objectives:
* Learn to test drive-programs with multiple classes.
* Learn to break programs up into classes
* Learn to debug your programs
* Learn to build software as a pair
* Learn to explain why test-driving, object orientated design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers

## Plans to achieve:
1. Complete testing methods with equality
2. Complete classes with equality
3. Complete testing for errors
4. Complete skill challenges  
5. Pairing

## Evidence
1. Design a single-method program [here]
2. Design a class [here]
3. Design a class system [here]

## What i've learnt
- Creating classes and multi-classes (how they interact with each another)
- Concepts- such as TDD & user stroies
- Pairing - how to get the most of the sessions, and how to be a good pair 
- Debugging process

## Reflection

### Question 1 
Did you meet all of your goals that you set at the beginning of the week?

- I completed the majority of my goals, I enjoyed the last challenge in skill challenges even though I was unable to finish it all due to time. It was useful doing a challenge where I had to use everything that I had learnt in the past few weeks and apply it. It also helped me look at areas that I need to improve on.


### Question 2
What would you improve/change moving forward?

- I want to imprve on my knowledge of multi-classes 
- Improve on my TDD skills, and make sure I follow the process
- Make sure at the beginning of pairing sessions that we discuss when to take breaks and when to switch between driver/navigator.
